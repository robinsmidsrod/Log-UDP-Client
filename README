Log-UDP-Client 0.01

This module enables you to send a message (simple string or complicated
object) over a UDP socket to a listening server. The message will be
encoded with a serializer module (default is Storable). If you also use
Log::UDP::Server you can receive that packet, decode it and do whatever you
want with it.

The nice thing about UDP is that it is non-blocking in nature, so if your
listening server is down or unavailable, the messages will just be sent into
the void. Your application won't notice the difference.
