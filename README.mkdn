# NAME

Log::UDP::Client - A simple way to send structured log messages via UDP

# VERSION

version 0.20.0

# SYNOPSIS

    use Log::UDP::Client;

    # Send the simple scalar to the server
    Log::UDP::Client->new->send("Hi");

    # Log lots of messages
    my $logger = Log::UDP::Client->new(server_port => 15000);
    my $counter=0;
    while(++$counter) {
        $logger->send($counter);
        last if $counter >= 1000;
    }

    # Send some debugging info
    $logger->send({
        pid     => $$,
        program => $0,
        args    => \@ARGV,
    });

    # Use of JSON serializer
    my $logger = Log::UDP::Client->new( serializer_module => 'JSON' );

    # Will emit { "message" => "Hi" } because JSON want to wrap stuff into a hashref
    $logger->send("Hi");

    # Use of custom serializer
    use Storable qw(freeze);
    my $logger = Log::UDP::Client->new (
        serializer => sub {
            return nfreeze( \( $_[0] ) );
        },
    );

# DESCRIPTION

This module enables you to send a message (simple string or complicated object)
over an UDP socket to a listening server. The message will be encoded with a
serializer module (default is [Storable](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Storable)).

# ATTRIBUTES

## server\_address : Str

IP address or hostname for the server you want to send the messages to.
This field can be changed after instantiation. Default is 127.0.0.1.

## server\_port : Int

Port for the server you plan to send the messages to.
This field can be changed after instantiation. Default is port 9999.

## throws\_exception : Bool

If errors are encountered, should we throw exception or just return?
Default is return. Set to true for exceptions. You can change this flag
after instantiation.

## socket : IO::Socket::INET

Read-only field that contains the socket used to send the messages.

# METHODS

## send($message)

Instance method that actually encodes and transmits the specified message
over UDP to the listening server. Will die if throw\_exception is set to true
and some kind of transmission error occurs. The message will be serialized by
the instance-defined serializer. Returns true on success.
